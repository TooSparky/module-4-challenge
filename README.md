# Module-4-Challenge

## Description

I built this application to take a quick JavaScript quiz and save the highscores to compare with friends. By using html, javascript, and css, i was able to work on the application.

## Installation

Go to the deployed application link here:
https://toosparky.github.io/module-4-challenge/

## Usage

Click start and answer the questions, then save the score to a seperate page where you can then save multiple scores, or clear them. Unfortunately, I could not get the application to run properly after extensive work. The project only displays the questions, and does not save the score.
